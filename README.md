  ## How to Use
  
* `process_data.py`: Processing of data sets, including partitioning of training sets and test sets, and average partitioning of positive samples  .  
* `base_classifiers.py`: Construct a baseline model and obtain its probabilistic predictive value.
* `fea_extract.py`: Feature Descriptors.
* `PACOVP.py`: Building mate-model, and the performance of the model's performance.
